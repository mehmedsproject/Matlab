    Block-Type Pilot Insertion Oriented Channel Estimation, A BPSK Modulation And BER vs SNR Performance In Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) System With AWGN Channel using Matlab

  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital modulation technique that is
widely used in Wi-Fi, cellular communication such as LTE, 4th generation wireless systems.
Advanteges:

  - High data rate, 
  - High bandwidth,
  - Efficient transmission capability
  - Immunity or resistance to multipath fading and Inter-Symbol Interference(ISI) [1].

  This matlab implementation aims to estimate the channel of OFDM systems in band-limited Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels by
improving the system performance in terms of bit error rate (BER).


Notes: This implementation project was created by three-person team project members including me, initially. 
       
       I thank you my college friends Oğuzhan and İbrahim for the early version creation of this OFDM system Matlab Implementation in college years. Then, I modified and improved of that version.
