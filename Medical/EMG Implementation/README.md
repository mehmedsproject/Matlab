% EMG Matlab Implementation
  - "The text file "emgData1.txt" contains a section of electromyography trace data for the wrist muscle recorded with an electromyography instrumentation device designed by me."
  - Some data informations are the followings:
       - Sampling Frequency = 2khz,
       - Record time = 30 seconds,
       - Recorded samples : 60K sample,
       - Data is shown in the magnitude of mV on the graphs, which are generated after the running the .m file

  - Note: I modified and rearrange the matlab code to process my own collected EMG signal data in this video source : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMbjmPFZtNg
